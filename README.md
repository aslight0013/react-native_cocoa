**It's not a production-ready yet**

## Getting started

```
npm install react-native-desktop-cli -g
cd projects
react-native-desktop init MyProject
```
Since it's simply a fork of React Native, basically you just can follow [the same steps](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content).
Feel free to ask anything on `#react-native-desktop` channel if you run into problems (and you probably will).

If you are into React.js please help to make examples look clean and idiomatic. If you can give an advice on Windows or Linux bindings or just have an idea for an awesome app which you always wanted, please feel free to reach me out on `#react-native-desktop`.
